# Sun Country Delays
## Background and Overview

This project focuses on analyzing airline delay performance at Sun Country Airlines for the months of August and September 2024. Delays in airline operations can have significant operational, financial, and customer satisfaction impacts. Therefore, understanding the root causes of these delays and identifying actionable insights is crucial for improving overall operational efficiency and performance.

### Context and Problem Statement:
Airline delays can be categorized into controllable and uncontrollable delays. Controllable delays, which are within the airlineâ€™s operational control, offer opportunities for improvement and optimization. On the other hand, uncontrollable delays (such as weather or air traffic control) may not provide direct levers for operational change. This analysis primarily focuses on controllable delays, examining the top delay codes and trends to better understand their operational impact.

Sun Country seeks to improve on-time performance, reduce delay occurrences, and optimize resource allocation based on delay patterns. The primary challenge is identifying the key drivers of delays and understanding how they vary across different dimensions such as aircraft, airport, and the department responsible for the delay.

### Project Goals:
1. Identify the most common delay codes to understand the primary causes of controllable delays within the airline's operations.
2. Analyze delay trends over time to identify any seasonal or operational patterns.
3. Assess the impact of delays on on-time performance and overall operational efficiency.
4. Provide actionable insights for airline management to target improvements in areas with the greatest operational impact.
5. Recommend strategies to minimize delays by identifying high-frequency delay categories and their root causes.
This project aims to deliver a comprehensive view of airline delay performance and uncover opportunities for operational improvements by leveraging Power BI and Excel-based analysis.

## Data Structure Overview
This project analyzes airline delay data from Sun Country Airlines across August and September 2024. The data is structured across multiple tables and contains information on flight delays, delay codes, corresponding categories, and performance metrics related to airline operations. The key data tables and columns used in this project are described below:
