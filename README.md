# Sun Country Delays Dashboard
## Background and Overview

This Power BI dashboard project was developed to provide a comprehensive tool for tracking and analyzing flight delay trends at Sun Country Airlines. Every day, an Operations (OPS) briefing is held with managers from various departments to review the previous day's performance and provide insights into the current dayâ€™s operations. While this briefing provides a high-level summary, no interactive dashboard allows the Airport Coordination Center (ACC) managers to explore flight delay data in more detail.

The dashboard addresses this gap by enabling managers to analyze flight delays across multiple dimensions, including aircraft type, arrival airports, delay codes, and the Manager on Duty (MOD) during incidents. This interactive dashboard allows users to explore patterns, identify key delays drivers, and support data-driven decision-making for operational improvements. It serves as a valuable tool for understanding and improving operational performance by visualizing delay trends and offering insights into the areas that require attention.

This Dashboard was created in tandem with the Sun Country Delays Excel project as an extra user-friendly tool to explore delay trends across multiple dimensions, such as aircraft, arrival airports, delay codes, and managers on duty (MOD), to pinpoint recurring issues. There are two dashboards in this report that show the same visuals, although one visual shows all delays while the other shows only controllable delay data.
