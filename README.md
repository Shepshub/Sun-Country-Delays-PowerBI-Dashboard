# Sun Country Delays
## Background and Overview

This Power BI dashboard project was developed to provide a comprehensive tool for tracking and analyzing flight delay trends at Sun Country Airlines. Every day, an Operations (OPS) briefing is held with managers from various departments to review the previous day's performance and provide insights into the current dayâ€™s operations. While this briefing provides a high-level summary, there is no interactive dashboard that allows the managers in the Airport Coordination Center (ACC) to explore flight delay data in more detail.

The dashboard addresses this gap by enabling managers to analyze flight delays across multiple dimensions, including aircraft type, arrival airports, delay codes, and the Manager on Duty (MOD) during incidents. This interactive dashboard allows users to explore patterns, identify key drivers of delays, and support data-driven decision-making for operational improvements. It serves as a valuable tool for understanding and improving operational performance by visualizing delay trends and offering insights into the areas that require attention.

This Dashboard was created in tandem with the Sun Country Delays excel project as an extra tool to explore
