# Sun Country Delays
## Background and Overview

This Power BI dashboard project was developed to provide a comprehensive tool for tracking and analyzing flight delay trends at Sun Country Airlines. Every day, an Operations (OPS) briefing is held with managers from various departments to review the previous day's performance and provide insights into the current day’s operations. While this briefing provides a high-level summary, there is no interactive dashboard that allows the managers in the Airport Coordination Center (ACC) to explore flight delay data in more detail.

The dashboard addresses this gap by enabling managers to analyze flight delays across multiple dimensions, including aircraft type, arrival airports, delay codes, and the Manager on Duty (MOD) during incidents. This interactive dashboard allows users to explore patterns, identify key drivers of delays, and support data-driven decision-making for operational improvements. It serves as a valuable tool for understanding and improving operational performance by visualizing delay trends and offering insights into the areas that require attention.

### Context and Problem Statement:
Airline delays can be categorized into controllable and uncontrollable delays. Controllable delays, which are within the airline’s operational control, offer opportunities for improvement and optimization. On the other hand, uncontrollable delays (such as weather or air traffic control) may not provide direct levers for operational change. This analysis primarily focuses on controllable delays, examining the top delay codes and trends to better understand their operational impact.

Sun Country seeks to improve on-time performance, reduce delay occurrences, and optimize resource allocation based on delay patterns. The primary challenge is identifying the key drivers of delays and understanding how they vary across different dimensions such as aircraft, airport, and the department responsible for the delay.

### Project Goals:
1. Identify the most common delay codes to understand the primary causes of controllable delays within the airline's operations.
2. Analyze delay trends over time to identify any seasonal or operational patterns.
3. Assess the impact of delays on on-time performance and overall operational efficiency.
4. Provide actionable insights for airline management to target improvements in areas with the greatest operational impact.
5. Recommend strategies to minimize delays by identifying high-frequency delay categories and their root causes.
This project aims to deliver a comprehensive view of airline delay performance and uncover opportunities for operational improvements by leveraging Power BI and Excel-based analysis.

## Data Structure Overview
This project analyzes airline delay data from Sun Country Airlines across August and September 2024. The data is structured across multiple tables and contains information on flight delays, delay codes, corresponding categories, and performance metrics related to airline operations. The key data tables and columns used in this project are described below:
